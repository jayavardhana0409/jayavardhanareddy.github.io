                <p>This project entails the development of a comprehensive data cleaning script tailored for the Nashville Housing dataset. The script addresses various data preprocessing
                    <span id="nashville-read-more-content" style="display: none;">
                        tasks, including the extraction and conversion of dates into a standardized format, handling null values by updating them based on specific criteria, and splitting address fields to improve data granularity. Additionally, it includes functionality to extract components from the OwnerAddress field, standardize values in the SoldASVacant column, and remove duplicate rows efficiently. With meticulous attention to detail and clear documentation, this script streamlines the data cleaning process, ensuring data integrity and consistency for further analysis. Users are advised to back up their data and customize the script according to their database structure and requirements before implementation.

                    This project showcases a collection of SQL queries tailored for COVID-19 data analysis, utilizing two primary tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. The
                    <span id="Covid-read-more-content" style="display: none;">
                        queries encompass diverse tasks, ranging from basic row counting to advanced calculations such as death percentages and vaccination rates. Notably, it includes queries for retrieving and filtering data based on specific criteria, calculating percentages at both country and global levels, and analyzing vaccination trends. Additionally, the project introduces views and temporary tables for enhanced data visualization and manipulation, facilitating comprehensive insights into the pandemic's impact. With its broad scope and analytical depth, this project demonstrates proficiency in SQL data manipulation and offers valuable insights into understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis.
